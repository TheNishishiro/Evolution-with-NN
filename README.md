# About
One of my older projects and attempt to sort of merge evolution algorithm with neural networks where I treat weights between neurons as part of an entity DNA.
Goal of it is to have "flies" or whatever you can call it to eat food randomly placed on map, if they don't eat or eat too much they will die.
